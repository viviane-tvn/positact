                                The climate crisis is an overwhelming challenge.
                                “A safe climate is considered by many to be a
                                vital element of the right to a healthy
                                environment” (UN Environment Programme, 2023),
                                and its protection is entirely dependent on the
                                actions and behaviours of the people at large.
                                The recovery of this human-induced emergency is
                                at the mercy of the human response.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As such, the climate crisis sits at the top of
                                humanity’s priority list and at the forefront of
                                the news cycle – a fair segment of the news is
                                dedicated to covering its progress.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since human involvement and active participation
                                is key to climate remediation, mobilization is
                                high on the climate action agenda. Current
                                civilization needs to be galvanized into
                                breaking out of the traditional, environmentally
                                harmful societal norms – it necessitates
                                motivation to reach for meaningful change. This
                                is achievable through the spread of information:
                                people need to understand and feel the gravity
                                of the issue in order to seek change. The media
                                is instrumental in communicating the state of
                                affairs – the news represent a powerful medium
                                for conveying the urgency of the climate crisis.
                                It communicates the existing and continued
                                assault on the environment, the latest available
                                scientific reports, the international policy
                                negotiations in climate change governance and
                                associated politics, and the direct consequences
                                of the climate change seen around the globe. It
                                is important for the news to do so, because to
                                effectively engage the public in societal
                                change, it requires the public to feel the
                                urgency that will enable them to seek behavioral
                                changes.

                                Additionally, research shows solid evidence of a
                                “negativity bias”, where despite subjects
                                expressing that they preferred good news, they
                                chose stories with a negative tone over neutral
                                or positive ones. Psychologists have identified
                                our collective, subconscious hunger to hear and
                                remember bad news – our attention is captured by
                                negative words (Stafford, 2014). Since high
                                readership and viewer ratings translate to
                                profit for media outlets, they are ultimately
                                incentivized to produce negative stories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our predilection for bad news combined with the
                                strategy to spur societal action through a high
                                volume of information ultimately leads to a
                                packed, negative news cycle – it is
                                overwhelming. The resulting effect is that every
                                day, we are faced – bombarded – with the harsh
                                reality of our changing world through the latest
                                reports of depressing scientific data and events
                                from around the globe. Communities are
                                experiencing an array of first-hand impacts of
                                the climate crisis: fires, floods, droughts,
                                hurricanes. Large corporations are continuing to
                                mine for oil. Biodiversity loss is reaching an
                                unprecedented rate. Elected powers are failing
                                to act.

                                This leads to the phenomenon of climate anxiety
                                or eco-anxiety (Wright & Osterloff, n.d.). The
                                American Psychology Association (APA) describes
                                eco-anxiety as “the chronic fear of
                                environmental cataclysm that comes from
                                observing the seemingly irrevocable impact of
                                climate change and the associated concern for
                                one's future and that of next generations”
                                (Iberdrola, n.d.). This internalization of great
                                environmental problems manifests itself as
                                psychological consequences with varying
                                seriousness, but common symptoms involve
                                feelings of hopelessness, fear and grief (Wright
                                & Osterloff, n.d.). These mindsets are not
                                primed to tackle climate change.

                                Despite the news cycle being a strong agent for
                                change – a communicative and connective tool –
                                its current systematic focus on negativity can
                                counterintuitively paralyze its viewers. Instead
                                of motivating change, it spreads environmental
                                doom, causing feelings of hopelessness so deep
                                that it pushes people to give up. It drives
                                people to feel too powerless to enact meaningful
                                change. This project aims to combat this trend.
                                It intends to break the cycle of negativity with
                                supportive actions directly opposing or
                                neutralizing this negativity.

                                Jamison (2010) observes connections between
                                climate change knowledge and social movements
                                and acknowledges the role of passions and
                                emotions. Here, we aim to harness the power of
                                positive feedback and positive reinforcement to
                                transform climate change knowledge into actions
                                in pursuit of climate justice. “Hope and
                                optimism are crucial for fighting climate
                                change” (Hayhoe, 2021). The psychological method
                                of positive reinforcement is evidenced as
                                powerful and effective to reach desired
                                outcomes. “Positive reinforcement refers to the
                                introduction of a desirable or pleasant stimulus
                                after a behavior. The desirable stimulus
                                reinforces the behavior, making it more likely
                                that the behavior will reoccur” (Ackerman,
                                2019). To reference the Theory of Change (REF),
                                the long-term goals of climate action is to
                                navigate societal change toward sustainable
                                living, and these can be reached through
                                patterns of behavioural change in the community
                                shaped by positive reinforcement strategies.

                                “Every fraction of a degree of global heating
                                avoided makes a difference” (Morton, 2022).
                                While the climate crisis as a whole can be
                                presented as a condemned affair, every small act
                                of change deserves celebration, and through
                                positive reinforcement, has the power to incite
                                others.

                                    up trash, etc., are seemingly irrelevant in
                                    the grand scheme. They can seem meaningless
                                    – powerless – in the face of the immensity
                                    that is the climate crisis. However, these
                                    small acts are nothing but, especially when
                                    accumulated. They are individually
                                    important, and even more so when amassed by
                                    the collective. If the small act receives
                                    positive feedback whenever it is performed,
                                    and provides data on its contribution to the
                                    solution, it can feed the positive loop that
                                    will prompt more small acts.

                                    acts of our neighbors (anonymously). It can
                                    notify us of the small, local acts from

                                Like a standard newspaper application, the
                                application has a newsfeed focusing on what’s
                                going on in the world in the field of climate
                                action, using a positive lens. It features news
                                articles highlighting the advances made globally
                                toward climate justice. This can include all
                                facets of the news coverage: politics, business,
                                social movements, scientific and technological
                                advancements, and so on.

                                    conscious choice, they are encouraged to log
                                    it.

                                    For example: if a user uses a reusable cup,
                                    a message full of positivity will pop up:
                                    “good work!”. This is followed by data on
                                    how many single-use cups have been saved
                                    from landfill that day, or how many have
                                    been saved through this individual’s choices
                                    alone, or how many have been saved globally.
                                    The idea is to introduce facts that make
                                    this small act seem nothing but small!

                                    Individual progress reports are generated,

                                data collection. As a mobile application, the
                                back-of-house programming is crucial in
                                information gathering and therefore assessment

                                Tracking the impact of the positivity influx is
                                measured through these hard metrics: a high
                                volume of users is directly proportional to a
                                high success rate for positive influence.

                                Metrics are also obtained directly from the
                                user. Questionnaires are used at milestones
                                concerning both the experience of the user with
                                the application, along with the user’s mindset
                                regarding the climate crisis. The impact of the
                                positivity is tracked through the user’s
                                responses: a user’s increased feelings of hope
                                in the face of the climate crisis and a decrease
                                in helplessness are of measures of success.
