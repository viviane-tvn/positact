                        <h3>Their Intenentions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Project Drawdown is “the world’s leading resource
                            for climate solutions” (Project Drawdown, n.d.)! In
                            other words, it is the world’s leading climate
                            solutions database. It intends to, quite simply,
                            stop climate change as quickly, safely, and
                            equitably as possible through the collection of
                            research-backed databases of solutions. Its reach is
                            broad: it works across all sectors, time, and
                            geographies to maximize co-benefits and eliminate
                            barriers. It works on all aspects of the climate
                            equation by focussing on stopping sources of
                            emissions and supporting sinks, as well as
                            supporting society in achieving broader
                            transformations. In short, it supports all projects
                            that have any capacity to help the world reach
                            “drawdown” – the tipping point of greenhouse gases
                            emissions into its decline.

                        <ul>
                            Project Drawdown pursues these actions “globally,
                            simultaneously, and with determination:

                            <li>Reduce Sources — bringing emissions to zero</li>
                            <li>
                                Support Sinks — uplifting nature’s carbon cycle
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improve Society — fostering equality for all”
                                (Project Drawdown, n.d.).

                        <h3>Their Aims & Strategies</h3>
                        <p>
                            Its inherent goal is this: in order for the world to
                            reach drawdown, it must work together. The climate
                            crisis is a global problem – the world’s largest,
                            shared challenge – with a unanimous agreement that
                            this existential threat affects all life on the
                            planet. Project Drawdown facilitates this by
                            collecting libraries of science-backed solutions
                            across all sectors and geographies. It is by sharing
                            information – existing scientific and technological
                            advancements – that the collective can attain
                            drawdown. It uses research and analysis to focus on
                            solutions that are available, scalable,
                            quantifiable, financially viable, and have a net
                            positive impact. These must reduce greenhouse gases
                            by avoiding or sequestering emissions, and are
                            evaluated through profound analysis of scientific
                            literature and modelling. A climate solution is only
                            as effective as its ability to be put to effect, and
                            the world benefits from Project Drawdown’s capacity
                            to share these proven models. The aim is to use
                            research to illustrate how the world can reach
                            drawdown by 2050 using currently existing and
                            available climate solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Project Drawdown also aims to advance the next level
                            of business leadership on climate solutions through
                            its Drawdown Labs. It is its private sector testing
                            group for facilitating the integration of climate
                            solutions quickly, safely, and equitably. It
                            recognizes the private sector’s potential –
                            influence and capital – in maximize their
                            contribution towards reaching “net zero”. By
                            engaging employees in climate solutions, it
                            contributes skills, resources, and people into the
                            movement. It encourages businesses to set a new
                            standard for climate leadership, and to shift
                            capital away from carbon-intensive activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Its other subgroup, Drawdown Lift, aims to deepen
                            understanding of the links between climate change
                            solutions and poverty alleviation, especially in
                            countries of the Global South. Many communities,
                            mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia hit the
                            trifecta of injustice: they bear little
                            responsibility for emissions, have low accessibility
                            to resources, and their location leads to high
                            exposure to climate threats. In short, the least
                            equipped to protect themselves face the greatest
                            risks from impacts. Drawdown Lift works to advance
                            climate solutions that have benefits for boosting
                            the well-being of these rural communities through
                            the synthesis of knowledge, connection of leaders
                            and audiences, and encouragement of decision-makers.
