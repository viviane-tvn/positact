                        <h3>Their Intenentions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Climate 200 is the ideal initiative – an absolute
                            gift – for politically illiterate but well-meaning
                            citizens such as myself. Actually, I should amend
                            that it’s only less than ideal because I am a
                            Canadian citizen and have not yet been extended
                            voting rights in Australia. Their principal
                            contribution is “climate-proofing” Australian
                            politics: they single out values that can be
                            important to the community, and support and unite
                            candidates who share these values.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            The values are:
                            <li>
                                “A science-based response to the climate crisis;
                            </li>
                            <li>Restoring integrity to politics</li>
                            <li>
                                Advancing gender equity” (Climate 200, n.d.)
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            It is crowd-funded, community-based initiative that
                            looks to impact climate change through the political
                            sphere. By throwing their weight behind political
                            candidates who advocate these values, they do the
                            research for the community and make supporting the
                            prioritization of the environment in the political
                            agenda accessible. In order for the government to be
                            a powerful change-agent in the climate crisis – in
                            order to scale climate solutions – the elected need
                            to prioritize the environment in their
                            decision-making and policymaking. Their agendas need
                            to be both green and elected. Climate 200 clarify
                            make it clear who these candidates are and support
                            their road to election.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their intention “is for every government in
                            Australia to adopt a science-based response to the
                            climate crisis” (Climate 200, n.d.). To touch back
                            on the fact that I do not yet have Australian
                            citizenship, I correct again – this organization is
                            appropriate for non-voters. It gives us an
                            opportunity to participate in the electoral arena –
                            it gives non-voters a voice. While we cannot
                            directly support candidates and parties who
                            prioritize environmental issues, Climate 200
                            provides opportunities to get politically involved
                            indirectly. By contributing to this organization,
                            through dedicating time, funds, or spreading
                            interest, it opens a pathway to support the climate
                            agenda without casting a vote.

                        <p>
                            Climate 200’s aims are to select community-backed
                            campaigns in the most strategic electorates – they
                            identify the campaigns that will most benefit from
                            their support and have a likelihood of winning if
                            aided. They choose according to where their support
                            will make the most difference. Once selected, they
                            put their full backing behind the candidates and
                            communities by providing tools, strategies,
                            expertise, data, and funding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They work to collect as many votes as possible for
                            their candidates through communication with the
                            community and public awareness. They take on the
                            campaign as if their own: their aim is to get the
                            chosen candidates elected into power so that they
                            can instill the values into governmental systems and
                            create change from influential positions – in short,
                            to scale climate and gender equity solutions

                                with information about their effective and

                    We recognise that Indigenous peoples are on the front line
                    of climate impacts, and must play a critical role in shaping
                    climate solutions.

                    This website was created on Gadigal land in Australia, where
                    sovereignty was never ceded.
