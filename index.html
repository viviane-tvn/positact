                            Climate 200 is an Australian initiative that
                            supports political candidates prioritizing climate
                            action and gender equity, aiming to influence
                            government policies through strategic campaigns and
                            community involvement.

                        <p>
                            Restore Blue aims to restore and protect coastal
                            wetlands, such as saltmarshes and mangroves, which
                            provide valuable ecosystem services and store "blue"
                            carbon, making them a vital part of the climate
                            solution. They collaborate with global partners and
                            use the best-available science and rigorous legal
                            standards to restore a minimum of 10,000 hectares of
                            lost blue carbon wetlands by 2030.

                            They have identified and ranked 100 of the most
                            effective climate solutions, such as renewable
                            energy, regenerative agriculture, and reducing food
                            waste, based on their potential to reduce emissions
                            and their cost-effectiveness.
