                            Restore Blue aims to restore and protect coastal
                            wetlands, such as saltmarshes and mangroves, which
                            provide valuable ecosystem services and store "blue"
                            carbon, making them a vital part of the climate
                            solution. They collaborate with global partners and
                            use the best-available science and rigorous legal
                            standards to restore a minimum of 10,000 hectares of
                            lost blue carbon wetlands by 2030.
